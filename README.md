My repository is a digital archive for my research project, but it is also for my future submissions, so I keep track of everything that I create.
Within this repository, I will hold my data sets, reflections, and timelines. My repository will overall allow people to understand how digital tools can help preserve and allow for a visual aspect when it comes to dance.
