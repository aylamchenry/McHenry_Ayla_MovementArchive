My mini-project script in MATLAB processes movement data on motifs from La visite, by Wanjiru Kamuyu and Tommy Pascal. The data is derived from the data in my CSV file, which creates two figure visualizations. It does so by importing the information through the dataset I created, which has sections that describe the purpose of the data collection. Such as timestamps, motifs, duration of the motifs, and who was performing the motif. Using this data, it creates two figures that display the data given.
